## Testing Summary
  
Throughout the course of development, we tested and refined our project. We have been in contact with our module leads and industry partners, as well as presenting to and interacting with potential users and care workers, and sent them our progress periodically to gain helpful feedback.

  
## Performance testing
  
#### Testing methodology
  
We installed our version MotionInput on 4 machines, along with a suite of games. We then measured the frame rate of MotionInput by itself as a baseline, and while playing each of the games, over a one minute time period, on each system.

| System ID | Specifications                          | Operating System |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1         | (CPU/RAM/GPU/Disp. Resolution/...)      | (Windows 10/...) |
| 2         |                                         |                  |
| 3         |                                         |                  |

## User acceptance testing
  
In the final week of development, we demonstrated our work at GOSH (Great Ormond Street Hospital) to healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, etc.) and other interested parties, and asked them to try it out, and gathered their feedback and constructive criticisms, along with other MotionInput teams. We endeavoured to address these if it was actionable in the remaining time. Here is a table of some of that feedback.

| ID | Feedback                                                         | Actionable | Comments                                        |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Buttons should light up in a different color                     | Yes        | Change color                                    |
| 2  | Difficult to reach center buttons with right hand                | Yes        | Move to right side                              |
| 3  | Doesn't detect well when other people are in camera              | No         | Perhaps in future expansions                    |
| 4  | Have to stand very far back to fit full body in camera           | No         | Req. of mediapipe, perhaps can use large screen |
| 5  | Some games are too difficult/active to play                      | No         | Not all games very compatible                   |
| 6  | Difficult to understand how to use without explanation           | Yes        | Create user manual                              |
