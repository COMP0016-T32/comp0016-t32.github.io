# MI v3.2 Team 32 - FeetNav

The software installs from the Windows Store directly to your Windows 10/11 PC. It will appear as UCL MI3.2 FeetNav.
The GUI interface has the following three modes to choose from:

1. Retro Games mode
2. Mouse mode
3. Modern Games mode

1. Retro Games mode
    1. Select the mode from the Feet Controller Template drop down list. There are three templates available, which are Retro Gamepad (2 buttons), Retro Gamepad (3 buttons), and Retro Gamepad (4 buttons).
    2. After selecting the mode, you can check the default settings for each mode by clicking the In-Air Action Buttons button and the Dance Mat Keys button. The In-Air Action Buttons window displays the key mapping (the key to trigger), key action (hold or press the key selected), and the display of the In-Air Action Buttons. The Dance Mat Keys window displays the key mapping and key action of the four gestures (moving the right foot forward, backward, rightward, and moving the left foot leftward).
    3. When clicking on the Edit button, you will enter the edit mode.
        1. You can choose to add Mouse Tracking by checking the Mouse Tracking checkbox and select to use Mouse Tracking with your left hand or right hand by selecting the corresponding option in the Mouse Tracking drop down list.
        2. When clicking on the In-Air Action Buttons button, the In-Air Action Buttons window will open up. You can add or remove In-Air Action Buttons by checking or unchecking the In-Air Action Buttons checkboxes, change the key mapping and the key action by selecting another option in the corresponding drop down lists, and change the display of the buttons in the input fields.
        3. After you change everything as you desire, click the Apply button to save the changes or click the Launch button to save the changes and launch MotionInput.
2. Mouse mode
    1. Mouse mode allows you to control the mouse using feet movements and In-Air Action Buttons. You can check the settings by clicking on the In-Air Action Buttons button and the Dance Mat Keys button.
3. Modern Games mode
    1. This mode allows you to add your own controller templates. To add a template, click on the Add button. When the New Mode window opens, name the new template in the input field and then click the OK button.
    2. To delete a template, select the template you want to delete in the Feet Controller Template drop down list and click the Delete button.
    3. Similar to the Retro Games mode, you can enter the edit mode when clicking on the Edit button to make changes.

If you do not know how to use dance mat feature, click the question mark (?) button on top of the GUI program.
