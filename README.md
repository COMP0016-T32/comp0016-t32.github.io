# COMP0016-T32 Main Website

Welcome, this is team 32 of MotionInput v3.2.

## How to run the blog in local

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. To run the site locally, you need to install Ruby and RubyGems first. Then, install Jekyll and Bundler gems through the command line.

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Finally, run the following command in the root directory of the project to start the server.

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## How to write a blog post

To write a post, find the markdown file that you need to write on in the root directory. For example, if you want to put some content in the requirement section, please find `requirements.md` in the root directory.
