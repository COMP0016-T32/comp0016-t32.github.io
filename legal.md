## GDPR

MotionInput does not currently store and process any user information and is therefore GDPR compliant.

## Intellectual Property and dependencies

The intellectual property rights (including patent, copyright, database, registered or unregistered design rights or trade marks) of MotionInput fall under the UCL Studentship IP and is owned by UCL and, to the extent that any of the Studentship IP is not automatically owned by UCL, the developers and users assign their rights in the Studentship IP to UCL, with full title guarantee and free of encumbrances as a present assignment of existing and future rights. The developers and users also agree to execute such documents and provide such assistance as UCL may reasonably request at a later date for these purposes. Our contribution is owned and will be operated by UCL and our project clients, and thus any source code distribution of the project can only be distributed in accordance with UCL and the project clients, and hence is not available for use as open-source software unless specified explicitly by UCL and/or the project clients.
