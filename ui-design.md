## Sketches
  
After initial gathering of requirements, we drew some sketches.

As shown by the sketches, we planned to introduce a login system to the program where users can create accounts to save their personalised settings. They would be given the option to map the keys to their preferences and set the tremor sensitivity. We aimed to follow user requirements and human-computer interaction principles, thus making it simple, practical and obvious to use.
  
## Prototype
  
#### Initial prototype
  
We drew an initial prototype using figma. The pictures demonstrate how a user would set up the program and map keys.

#### Gaming Part
  
A visualization of how a user might play a game using their upper body or the virtual dance mat.

#### Evaluation of prototype
  
We conducted a heuristic evaluation to find issues in our prototype.

Based on the evaluation, we altered the prototype to better fit requirements.

#### Final prototype
  
This was the final version of the prototype. The arrows colored in light blue are examples of directions from the navigation bar. The home button directs to the main menu, the question mark goes to the help video, and the logged-in profile image goes to settings. The gaming part remains the same.

## Implementation

During development and after learning newer requirements, we found several ways in which we needed to differ from the prototype.
